# Your Personal Online Branding

**Build your online presence to support your professional career - STEP 1: LinkedIn**

## Life is Sales

You're always selling something. Yourself to a new job or to a new position within the current company, your product or service to potential customers or clients, your idea to your boss or to your peers within the same team, or maybe to colleagues another side of the world.

If you don't have at least some kind of agenda or cause that you want to promote, just going like a dead fish with the stream, you're most probably not even reading this anyways.

A great product sells itself, they say. But what if there are multiple great products available, and in this connected world there usually is? How do you make sure your clients can find you, or your product, get interested and contact you? A well-built online presence, personal branding, alone is not going to solve that. But its a good start.

This how-to is written mainly for the people in the tech business, who quite often, to put it nicely, have the biggest gap between their capabilities and how they present and promote themselves.

It's worth keeping in mind that in marketing, including branding, there is not one absolute right way to do things. This how-to represents my current views and is evolving with time.
