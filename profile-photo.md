# Profile Photo

Many people don't seem to underestimate the importance of a good profile photo. If you want to present yourself as a credible professional to work with, you should have a professional profile photo.

Profile photo can and will tell a lot about you to a person who you've never met before. It's part of the impression before the first impression, how people will prepare for a meeting you or talking on the phone with you.

## Choose a photo that looks like you

Or even before that, have a photo, and have a photo of you! For some strange reasons, some even otherwise professionally credible people either don't even have a profile photo, or have some Donald Duck or such in the profile...

To understand the importance of the profile photo think about this scenario:

You're having a video-conference with an important new contact for the first time, and for some reason network connection is bit shaky, and you're both using only voice. That new contact of yours hears your voice, but can see only whatever photo the conference tool (Skype, Hangouts, etc) is showing and what she found from your online profiles.

Would you like have your first impression to be based on:

A. No photo, or a bad photo of you?

B. Or a professional quality face photo of you smiling friendly to the camera?

### Hire a pro to take your profile photo

Most probably you're promoting yourself as a professional in whatever your field is, and telling your clients about the difference between a pro and an amateur. So when it comes to your profile photo, why you still settle down with a crappy selfie?

Ok, you don't necessarily have to have a professional to take your photo, but it definately won't hurt. In addition to quality of the photo itself, it also can give a signal that you takes work seriously, and understand that you need to invest both time and money in business. And sometimes that can be the small difference, at least make sure it won't be against you...

## Use enough big resolution

In the LinkedIn profile page, the photo is quite small but opens and zooms so make sure resolution is large enough.

LinkedIn's advice is between 400 (w) x 400 (h) pixels and 7680 (w) x 4320 (h) pixels:

## Make sure your face suits for a round avatar

A common advice is to make sure your face takes up at least 60% of the frame.

In addition to that, crop you photo so that it works well in a round avatar.

## Have a friendly, not creepy, smile

The point of the photo is to show you as a person people like to work with, and make you easy to approach.

If you don't feel comfortable smiling like insurance sales guy to camera, that's ok, don't. More important than showing all the teeth is to look and feel natural and friendly.

"Smile with your eyes" is an advice easy to say, but maybe difficult to follow. When taking the photo, force yourself to think about some nice things that make you happy, whether it's your family, hobbies, or good movie you saw last week. Thinking about happy things may sound silly, but can actually make you happy (instead of distracted from photo shooting!), and that shows in the photo too.

## Wear what you wear at work

Old piece of advice still work: dress up to the position you're looking for.

## Choose a background that isnâ€™t distracting

The purpose of the profile photo is to focus on your face, so try to have something simple as the background.

## Use same profile photo in all work related profiles

Sometimes names, titles and companies are easy to forget, but many people remember and recognize faces better.

Use the same profile photo in all your professional profiles (LinkedIn, Github, AngelList, Behance, etc) to make it easier for your clients recognize you. Also use the same photo in email and chat/call apps that you use for work.

Sounds boring? Maybe yes, feel free to play with your photos in Instagram or Snapchat, but keep in mind that on work related media, **your profile photo is not for you, it's for your clients.**

## Use the background image with more personal touch

Not maybe the most important part of your LinkedIn profile... but as such option is available, why not use it?

If your profile photo is about you, and more importantly about your face, maybe you want to show-off your mountain-biking interest, travel pictures or something personal in your background image? Or stick to strictly professional, and just promote your company?
