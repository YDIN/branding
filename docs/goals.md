# 1. Goals - What do you want to achieve with your branding?

*“Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?*

*The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.*

*Alice: I don't much care where.*

*The Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.”*

-Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

## 1.1. Define and write down your target client groups (1-3)

Can be simply your target clients, but also think about some of their key stakeholders.

For example the hiring manager might be your primary target, but company HR and legal may also look at your profile and have influence on the decision making.

Write things down (for yourself), it often forces you to really think and evaluate who you're targeting with your profile. Think about for each interesting client group:

- Age
- Experience
- Role (Initiator, Influencer, Gate-keeper, Decision-maker, Decision-maker's boss..)
- Interests, drivers, needs, ...

(More about profiling client organizations coming later in a separate HOW-TO...)

## 1.2. What reaction(s) do you want in your target client?

The first and most important reaction you want is to simply get your profile openeded. If your potential client sees you in LinkedIn search results or in the feed, and doesn't get interested enough to open your profile, whatever is in the profile doesn't matter. The first impression counts.

After you've "lured" a person to open your profile, for each defined client group, think about what you want them to do?

### A. "Approve you"

For example, above mentioned HR checks your profile and doesn't find reasons not to hire you.

### B. Connect with you

You look like a person you client wants to have in her professional network.

### C. Contact you

You want visitor to directly contact you related to a job, sales, etc.

### D. Recommend and/or connect you to someone else

The client sends your profile or an introduction to someone else that might be interested to get contact with you. Anyone with any sales experience knows the value of referrals or warm introductions.

### E. Something else, what?

> **Your goals might be something else, but make sure you build your profile for your target clients and the wanted reactions in mind!**
