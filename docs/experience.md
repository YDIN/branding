# 7. Your Work Experience is more than just titles and companies listed

Filling in the whole work history in detail can take some time and effort, but it's an investment.

As a professional, you anyways need to keep track of your past somewhere, so why not do that on LinkedIn where it's also easily visible to any stakeholder interested?

## 7.1. Arrange your work history into a logical order

Again, think about your clients: How to make going through your work history an easy and enjoyable experience, highlighting the most relevant positions.

LinkedIn collapses the work history and shows the last 5 positions by default. Make sure those 5 are the correct ones.

Make sure you have **the correct start and end months** for each work experience. For a long 20+ years work history it may not anymore matter that much, but still recommended.

LinkedIn arranges all work experiences based on start and end dates, and if you have had multiple jobs same time, it can become a bit messy. Make sure the different jobs are in a logical order you want. Splitting long work experiences into two or more can sometimes help with that...

## 7.2. Split long work experiences

If you have been working 8 years in the same company, don't try to squeeze those all into a one work experience with a title "Intern, engineer, manager and later CEO". 

Instead, split the experience into multiple separate work experiences based on the position, or other changes that may have occurred. Yes, maybe little bit more work, but now you can be more specific about your roles and results achieved in each position.

Also, if you have been working in different countries during one employment, make sure to split those into separate ones. Possible work experience abroad is something you don't want your clients to accidentally miss...

## 7.3. Fill any empty gaps in the work history

Make sure your work history doesn't have any gaps longer than 2-3 months. For a person reviewing your work history, the longer unexplained empty period will arise questions, and trust me, you don't want those questions.

For any longer than 3 months empty gap, add "a work experience" explaining it. 

If you were unemployed and looking for a new job, add that as an experience and explain in the description of how things went, in both good and bad. During a long work history, most of us are at some point unemployed and being open and honest about it only strengthens your brand.

If you took a half year off or even longer, again add that as an experience and describe what you did. When your potential clients will read about you taking a year off from "the rat race" to for example spend quality time with your family, travel the world, and renovate the house, instead of wondering what is that empty gap in the CV ("prison, maybe..?") they will look at you and think *"wow, that guy has balls... wish I had too!"*

Sometimes honesty is really the best policy!

## 7.4. Always choose the companies from the list

Most of the world's companies have LinkedIn pages, so when adding your work experience make sure you search and select the company from the list, instead of writing the company name yourself. In the worst case, misspell it.

When the company is selected from the list, not only the company logo will automatically be shown in your profile, but your profile can found from that company LinkedIn page, and also anyone checking your profile can easily click to see more details about the company.

If the company is/was your own, and is still missing, now is a good time to create a company LinkedIn page for it.

## 7.5. Don't leave locations empty

For each work experience add the country and city. Especially important if you have had an international work history.

---

## 7.6. Use the same structure for every work experience description

Be consistent. If you have 5 or more work experiences, and each of them described with different structure, style, and detail, it is not necessarily the image you want to give about yourself as a professional.

Description max length is 2000 characters, and in the desktop the full description is shown, so don't even think about going to the max... 

Write 2-3 chapters, each max 3-4 lines. Use lists if needed, but as always, keep the list items to max 5. Focus on easy readability, that usually also forces you to think about what's relevant and what can be left out.

The mobile app shows only the first 155 characters. Make sure the first 1-2 sentences are the most relevant and interesting part, to get visitor open the whole description.

**Example structure:**

Chapter 1: What you were doing, key tasks and what was your own role and key responsibility in the position?

Chapter 2: What were the key results you achieved in the position?

Chapter 3: What were the key things you learned, good or bad, in the position?

## 7.7. Add media to your work experiences

**Show, don't tell.**

In addition to text descriptions, any concrete evidence about your work experience not only makes it more credible but also much more interesting.

Add photos, online reviews, YouTube videos, architecture pictures, Github links, press release, app store links, ... Adding media to work experiences is perhaps one the most under-used powerful feature in LinkedIn to showcase yourself.

## 7.8. Volunteer Experience

Listing your volunteer experiences can be a great addition to showing your personal character and positive values in life. But be careful, some profiles make me think if that person was volunteering because he cares, or because he wanted to show that he cares...
