8. # Education

Education divides opinions. Some say it's not relevant after you've gained serious work experience, some look carefully your schools and graduations.

Just in case, make sure your education history is described in detail.

## 8.1. Select each school from the list

Same way like companies, pretty much every major school in the world is listed in LinkedIn, so pick up from the list instead of writing something on your own **to get your profile connected to that school.**

Earlier years of LinkedIn, the database of schools was smaller, and as a result many people had to write their own university names manually. If you're one of them, go check again, now most probably your school is already listed!

## 8.2. Have Degree, Field of study, Grades, From/To Years in detail

Sounds pretty basic, but still many people end up failing in such basic information. You really graduated from a school, but can't come up with details..?

LinkedIn gives only free-text fields, so make sure you fill in:

- Field of Study: In addition to school and degree, you choices of **major and minors** can tell a lot about your skills but also about you as a person
- Show-case your good grades (Don't add if bad or not relevant)
- Explain from/to years if needed in description: drop-out, long-time, exceptionally short time, ...

## 8.3. Count Activities and Societies as a work experience

Extracurricular activities can be sometimes be almost (or even more) important than the actual studies through networking and early age leadership and management experience gained.

List each role similar way as your work experience: role, task, achievements, key learnings.

## 8.4. Add Media to showcase you studies and extracurricular activities

**Show, don't tell.**

Upload you thesis, case studies or any other positive (no drunken student party photos) materials available to back up your studies.
