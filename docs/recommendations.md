# Recommendations do matter

It's easy to say their fake or irrelevant, but in a networked economy like LinkedIn, recommendations from right kind of persons can support your personal brand and build your credibility significantly.

## YOU MUST START ASKING FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EVERY JOB YOU HAVE HAD. NO EXCUSES.

If you have 10+ years of successful working history, and you can't find at least 5 credible professional people to recommend you... How successful has it really been..? 

A lot of people are willing to give you recommendations, but most probably they won't proactively do it. So you need to ask, and LinkedIn makes that really easy. **Don't be shy.**

Actually, getting asked to give a recommendation can be seen also as a compliment or flattering: recommendations are usually asked from people regarded as high-value profiles.

## Create your own 360 degrees review from recommendations

Not only your clients and superiors but also teammates or subordinates from previous jobs are great for recommendations. Think about recommendations like a 360-degree review. Ideally, you get feedback from all different stakeholders you work with.

When sending a recommendation request, you have to choose from various options what was your relationship (superior, colleague, client, etc).

## Always write a custom message when asking for recommendations

You're basically asking someone to do you a favor. Not only to recommend you, but the public nature of LinkedIn recommendations means, that the person writing the recommendation may want to put some time and effort into it.

LinkedIn gives a deadly boring default *"Hi Jack, can you write me a recommendation?"* but the least you can do is to write a polite custom message.

Even better, in your message explain shortly about your future plans, and why and what kind of a recommendation would help you. As an extreme example, you can write a draft recommendation yourself and give that as "an input".

**Whatever you do, try to make for the receiver giving the recommendation to you as easy as possible.**

Here's an example message:

*"Hi Jack,*

*I'm planning next career steps, moving more from current developer role towards project management.*

*I'm sending this to ask you for a brief recommendation of my work from the projext XZY we worked together that I can include in my LinkedIn profile. Please be honest and truthful, but if you can't come up with anything positive to say might be better just to ignore this message ;)*

*If you have any questions, let me know.*

*Thanks in advance for helping me out.*

*-Ilkka"*

## Give only honest recommendations to others

The recommendations you give are also important, not only to people you recommend, but they are also visible in your own profile.

Be always honest with what you write, if you can't do it, simply don't give recommendations. It's also your own reputation as a stake.
