# Recommendations

Recommendations do matter. It's easy to say their fake or irrelevant, but in a networked economy like LinkedIn, recommendations from right kind of persons can support your personal brand and build your credibility significantly.  Also, you don't want recommendations from the wrong people...

Not only your clients and superiors but also teammates or subordinates from previous jobs are great for recommendations. Think about recommendations like a 360-degree review. Ideally, you get feedback from all different stakeholders you work with.

A lot of people are willing to give you recommendations, but most probably they won't proactively do it. So you need to ask, and LinkedIn makes that really easy. Don't be shy.

The recommendations you give are also important. Be honest what you write, if you can't do it, simply don't give recommendations. It's also your own reputation as a stake.
