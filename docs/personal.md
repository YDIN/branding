# 2. Make your personal branding personal

**People like to work with people, not with CVs.**

LinkedIn is a professional networking site, and LinkedIn profiles are meant to be professional. But that doesn't mean you can't spice up your profile with who you actually are in real life.

> Sharing about yourself, your personal background, and things that are important to you in life, not only makes your profile more interesting but also makes you as a person easier to approach and start a conversation with.

## 2.1. Make your profile look and feel like you

A couple of parts of the LinkedIn profile exceptionally suitable to add your personal flavor:

**Background photo:** Keep your profile photo strictly professional, but play with the background photo. Your favorite golf course? Photo with your dog? Your motorcycle..?

**Headline:** Be careful here... Only if you know what you're doing!

**Summary:** You're writing about who you are, how could you possibly not mention what you're passionate about your free time?

**Media:** Keep your media uploads professional, but a screenshot of your the first C64 game can be both connected to your work as a game developer, but will immediately build a positive connection with most of the tech professional from that generation...

**Experience descriptions:** Use your imagination when explaining your past roles and achievements. Don't be boring.

**Interests:** Whom you follow and in which groups you belong can tell a lot about you.

**Posts and articles:** Like it or not, LinkedIn is a social media, and not only your own posts, but also your Likes are shown in your profile.

**Accomplishment:** Naturally the work-related accomplishments matter most, but also a perfect place share things that are important to you as a person. Rescue Diver Certificate? Alaska State Chess Champion 1995?

A sense of humor is usually a good thing, and something generally people appreciates. Just don't make a clown out of yourself.

## 2.2. Disclaimer: Remember who is your client

Of course, if you know that your target clients are exceptionally conservative and stick strictly only to business, then naturally it's better to minimize anything personal!
