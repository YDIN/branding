# 6. Summary

## 6.1. Keep the constraints in mind

Summary maximum length is 2000 characters, and for "a summary" that is not a short text...

For your profile visitor, the summary is not fully shown in collapsed mode, only first ~300 characters in desktop and ~160 characters in mobile app shown.

Most probably your summary is longer than that, so you should focus to the most important things in the first sentences (in case full summary is not opened at all)... or maybe a teaser to get to open the full summary?

## 6.2. Tailor your summary text for... a goldfish

Like in all the media, think about your audience as the goldfish, with an attention span of 10 seconds. If your summary takes longer to read, there's a high probability it won't be read at all.

---

## 6.3. Cut your summary text into chapters for easier reading

Only ideally 1-3 easy simple sentences per chapter. Separated chapters with empty lines.

Unless the point of your profile is to show-off your language skills.

---

## 6.4. Don't use long lists

List of bullet points is often a very practical way to show things. 

But if you use lists, a good rule of thumb to follow is to have max 5 items. If you have a list with more than 5, maybe you should already consider having more strict focus, or split it into two separate lists?

Too often people have lists of 27 different competencies in their profiles, which not only shows bad taste but also reveals that the person has absolutely no focus.

## 6.5. Think about your summary as a sales pitch

The LinkedIn summary isn’t about you. It’s about the person reading it. It's ultimately your sales pitch to your target client.

Before writing anything, go to Goals (LINK) and define who your target clients, and the reaction you want from them.

---

## 6.6. Use "I" instead of "he/she"

A lot of LinkedIn profile summaries are written in the 3rd person. "He is competent..." or "Ilkka is a good boy...".

Don't use 3rd person, write your own summary with "I...". That way the summary will be more personal, open, honest, and trustworthly.

## 6.7. Example structure: Past, Now, Future

Again, there is no one right way to write a perfect summary, but one approach is to build it around these questions:

1. What's your background?
2. What are you doing now?
3. What will you do in the future?

All as separate chapters with empty rows between.

### Introduction

First chapter, short 1-2 sentences, kind of an extension or a longer version of your headline.

This is visible for the visitors also when the summary is collapsed.

### Past

A couple of sentences about who you are, and a summary of your relevant work history.

This chapter should make the reader nod and think "yeah this is a pretty solid guy, been there and done that, good."

### Present

What are you doing now, what role and focus areas? What are your key capabilities today?

What kind clients are your helping, and what is the value your creating for them?

Why they choose you, how do you differentiate compared to lots of other similar people?

This chapter should make the reader know your current capabilities, and to realize that you're a focused high-performer today.

### Future

This is the most neglected part of many people's CVs and LinkedIn summaries: Describing where you want to go in the future, what do you want to do, what do you want to be?

Seeing summaries to talk about the future plans is actually so rare, that every time it is an interesting and exciting exception. It shows that **the person is first of thinking about the future**, driven and ambitious, and overall have some ideas what the future might look like.

To put it bluntly, a profile without future plans is just an offering for the reader: "here I am, take me if you're interested". While a profile saying "this is what I'm going to do in the future" is more like a challenge or an invite for the reader to join the journey.

### Something personal (optional)

Be a human.

Mission/purpose? What you are passioned about?

What do you do in the free time?

### Call to action (optional)

If you have something specific in mind, for example, you're looking for new opportunities, open for consulting gigs or volunteer work, add it to the end of the summary.

Be open about what kind of things you'd be interested in. Also, add your contact information and advice on how to contact you.

### Keywords

Q: Should add a list of keywords to end for search engines??? Not sure...

## 6.8. Test readability with desktop and mobile

LinkedIn is most probably full of profile summaries, that are never read by the person him/herself.

Read your profile to yourself in both desktop and mobile. Are there long and complicated sentences you could split into shorter ones? Would splitting a longish chapter into two separated by an empty row make it easier for the reader?

---

## 6.9. Add Media / Work Samples to your profile ("portfolio")

"You can display samples of your work on your LinkedIn profile such as external documents, photos, sites, videos, and presentations. Once this media has been added or linked to on your profile, you can edit or delete it at any time."

Media will be highly visible below your Summary in both collapsed and open mode and can be an effective way to get a profile visitor to open your Summary to see or read more in detail.
