# LinkedIn Dimensions

**To make LinkedIn work for you, it's important to understand how "the LinkedIn dimensions" works.**

---

## HORIZONTAL - How you can be found and verified ("social proof")

In addition to searching your name, or clicking a link to your profile somewhere outside Linkedin, your profile can be found multiple different ways.

To maximize you profile's "findability", make sure you enable all possible "horizontal channels":

- Connections (Other profiles)
- Location
- Keywords
- Schools
- Companies
- Skills
- Accomplishments
- Interests

---

## VERTICAL - How more information about you can be found

LinkedIn reveals information in "layers": just a teaser at first, and then more if the visitor gets interested and clicks deeper into your profile.

Make sure you build your profile content to encourage getting to level 4 (or at least 3):

### 1. Profile link

- Small profile photo
- Name
- Headline (max first ~60 characters)

"Preview++" in search results
- City and country
- Steps (your direct, 2nd, or more levels connection)
- Number of shared connections (if available)

### 2. The first impression (in addition to Preview)

- Profile photo
- Background photo
- Full headline
- Summary (first 2-3 sentences)
- Summary - Media files preview

### 3. Profile overview (in addition to the first impression)

- Activity
- Highlights
- Experience - 5 latest positions
- Education
- TOP3 skills
- Latest 2 recommendations
- Accomplishments overview
- Interests overview

### 4. Detailed profile (in addition to Profile overview)

- Full summary text
- All previous work experiences
- All Skills and Endorsements
- Accomplishments in detail
- All listed interests
