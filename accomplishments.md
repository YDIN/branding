## Languages

List all the languages you speak, even basics. Knowing some words in Japanese or French may not be enough for a conversation, but sometimes even that might be a differentiator compared to a person with no skills at all.

Interest to foreign languages is often connected to an interest in foreign cultures, and that's already a valued characteristic of a person, especially in any international business.
